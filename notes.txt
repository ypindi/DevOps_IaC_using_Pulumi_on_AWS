Pulumi for IaC.

Usually Domain specific language / JSON / YAML is used.
Because it is easy to use and also define resources.

But if we want to add conditionals:
1. Congitions: Create EC2 instance if this condition is met.
2. Loops: create 20 EC2 instances with the same configuration.
3. Functions: 20 EC2 with same configuration with some specific
configuration for each of them.

Hence, Pulumi allows writing IaC in a programming langauge
of your choice.
JS, TS, Python, C#, Go.

Pulumi you can use the language of choice where you have
expertise for building infrastructure.


You can also write tests like Unit and Integration tests for your
infrastructure code. Better understanding between Dev and Ops.

To create tools, frameworks, and dev tools.

resources are declared as objects in code.

Pulumi is like Git.
Pulumi Cloud is like GitHub.

Pulumi Cloud stores metadata, called State, so that it can manage your 
cloud resources. State is how the Pulumi CLI knows when and how to create, 
read, delete, or update cloud resources.

The first step in getting started with Pulumi is to download the CLI and 
connect your CLI session with your newly created Pulumi Cloud account.
